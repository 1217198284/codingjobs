Design a database that can be used by a library website. An author may write several books.

Each book is arranged in a shelf according to the type of work: 'Science-Fiction', 'References', 'Novels' ..
We will have 3 tables, for books, shelves and authors.

1. create the UML diagram of this database

2. Using PHPMyAdmin, create the tables and relationships. Use CASCADE options for the foreign key constraints.

3. Using PHPMyAdmin, add some books, authors and departments.

4. Delete a shelve. What happens to the books of the shelve?
