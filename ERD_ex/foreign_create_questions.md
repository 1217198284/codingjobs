We want to create a website where users can ask questions. 
The necessary fields for table Users: email,  last_connection (date and time) and Questions: title, content 

1. Add the foreign key to the correct table (hint: always in the child table). Use CASCADE options for the foreign key constraints.

2. Design the UML diagram of this relationship

3. Using PHPMyAdmin, create the tables and relationships. Use CASCADE options for the foreign key constraints.

4. Using PHPMyAdmin, insert some users and questions.

5. Delete a user. What is the effect on the question tables?
