We want to create a website where users can ask questions.

The necessary fields:
Users: email, last_connection (date and time)
Questions: title, content

1. Add the foreign key to the correct table (hint: always in the child table)

2. Design the UML diagram of this relationship.

3. Add some records by making the necessary links.
